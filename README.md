Read me file for the Plant World project.

This project is to demonstarte the basic use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The site fulifuls the responsive web design by making the navigation bar flex direction chnages from clumon in small mobile devices to raw in wider screens.The same behavior applies to the about and the main sections, the appear one beneath the other in small screens and one beside the other in larger screens.

The site uses JavaScript code and functions to implements a slideshow by providing left and right arrow buttons to flip the images. The start idea was to have one img element for every slide, this led to having 6 HTML lines for every image to display the associated lable and other visual effects. Using javascript I was hiding all image elemnts but the one at the current sequence. 

Then I optimized the code and made it shorter and smarter by using varaibles, arrays, and loops so I needed only one img element that I change its src attribute. I hope I had more time in order to optimize the JavaScript more by creating the slideshow elements (images, texts, and buttons) through Javascript NOT HTML.
