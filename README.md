Read me file for the Plant World project.

This project is to demonstarte the basic use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The site fulifuls the responsive web design by making the navigation bar flex direction chnages from clumon in small mobile devices to raw in wider screens.

The site uses JavaScript code and functions to implements a slideshow by providing left and right arrow buttons to flip the images.

I hope I had more time in order to optimize the JavaScript code and make it shorter and smarter by creating the slideshow elements (images, texts, and buttons) through Javascript NOT HTML.
